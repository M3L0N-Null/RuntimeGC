# What kind of changes may I contribute?
1. Bug fixes. Note that you must test it yourself at least.
2. New features. Note that you must test it with at least 5 players with various behaviors and mod loadouts.
3. UI optimizations. Not recommended; it's simply painful.
4. Translations. See Translation section for details.

# What shouldn't I commit?
1. ANY files in RuntimeGC/About folder. If you found a typo in About.xml, please post it as a new issue.
2. New features of executing any pawn cleanups with a tick-based/auto-triggered control behavior. If you do so, I will reject the whole pull request; because the damage caused by this kind of behaviors is hard to rollback, or you simply do not care about save-file-safety of other players.
3. Change CopyrightStr or other author info. I know that static string is so vulnerable, but it's enough to trick those mod-stealing websites who simply wipe out <author /> tag.
4. Things you shouldn't do in any other repos, such as hiding trojans, name variables with f??k words, use indefinite number of spaces for indentations.

# Why the code style is inconsistent?
Well...Have you heard of the term *"legacy code"*? I started this project with B16 one and a half years ago, and rewriting all codes is too risky for now.

# How can I make translation files for %s?
Follow the steps:
1. Enable RuntimeGC, go to Options-Mod Settings, select RuntimeGC, uncheck "Clear unused translations".
2. Copy RuntimeGC/Languages/English folder.
3. Translate all the Keyed contents. Please do not make DefInjections for MainButtonDef as it will be translated using 3 Keyed translations instead of using injections.
4. Make sure the .xml files are saved using UTF-8 charset.
5. Test your translations. *Make sure all button captions are not truncated and no errors appear in Translation Report.*
6. *(Optional)* Translate workshop description texts. **Recommended;** or other players using the same language will see English description texts instead.
7. Commit using PR. Make sure you are targeting the right branch.
8. Wait for comments. Once commented "Accepted", PR will be merged and released to mod sites **1 day later**. You can still tweak your commit during the period.
